- 👋 Hi, I’m @danhempel
- 👀 I’m interested in car performance, customization and tuning (Primarily Nissan/Infinity R35 GTR, 370z, 350z Nismo, G35) and a BMW 740 - old Durango for a daily! Finding side         projects, hardware, software or app development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Cripto Currency, the Coinbase API for creating bots and finding ways to make the most profit on Pi Zero's running bots 24/7. I am also in         the middle of developing my first automotiver performance product, which has been a fun and challenging goal, developing a few cell phone apps for another source of income,       all while teaching my son coding and development so he can follow in my footsteps. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Skype or Facebook Messenger, call or text (206) 659-6148‬ (it's Google voice so I am not always available). Would like todiscuss new projects or       hobbies, cars, whatever comes up.
